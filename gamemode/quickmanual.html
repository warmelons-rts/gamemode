	<h2>How to join a team</h2>
		<p>You have likely been automatically assigned a team. If not you may type &quot;/join #&quot;. You can also type /join &quot;color&quot; to join a team.</p>
		Server administrators may only allow so many players per team. Pick another team to join.<br />
		Any time a player joins a team it automatically locks so that they can keep out unwanted teammates. The team leader can unlock the team by typing &quot;/lock&quot; or invite people trough the f4 menu.<br />
	<h2>How to play</h2>
		<p>WMRTS got several tools that you use, they are all located in a sub-section called warmelons. You can however also use other tools that the server have, which makes building contraptions possible.</p>
		<p>To spawn melons or props you need a spawnpoint. It is a very important structure for your team, as if only 1 team has one, they will win.<br />
		The first spawnpoint is free, but after that they cost nrg. So if you want a forward base the outpost might be a better choice. You can not spawn melons normally at outposts, but you can spawn props and barracks.</p>
		<p>To earn nrg you have to send melons to capture points. The more capture points you have, the higher income and max melon count you have.<br />
		On some maps there is resource nodes. You can build harvesters which travel between those nodes and your spawnpoint (or outpost).</p>
		<p>You can also find communication uplinks on some maps. If you capture them a tool named melon strike is enabled. When you use it a carnister lands on the designated area with a minor explosion, and then release 6 small fighters.</p>
		<p>Melons take damage if in water, with the exceptions of harvesters and marine melons.</p>
		<p>For more information check out the encyclopedia (F2).</p>
